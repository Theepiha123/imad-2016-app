They also say that man is the most intelligent — and the most superior — species on earth. This is also false. It is very arrogant to assume that we are the most intelligent species when we keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. It has been shown that both rats and monkeys learn from making errors, yet we have not. Our history proves this. All creatures on earth have the capacity to love and grieve the same way we do. No life on the planet is more deserving than another. Those who think so, are the true savages.”\r\n― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem\r\n![It  is  about  wildlife  in  the  deep  forest](http://wallpapercave.com/wp/JWKHRq9.jpg)\r\n\r\n **WildGo Safari******\r\n\r\nAfrica has her mysteries and even a wise man cannot understand them. But a wise man respects them.”\r\nWe have a responsibility toward the other life-forms of our planet whose continued existence is threatened by the thoughtless behavior of our own human species. . . . Environmental responsibility – for if there is no God, then, obviously, it is up to us to put things right.![we  should  preserve  the  wildlife  ](http://wallpapercave.com/wp/r7TfR1w.jpg)\r\n\r\n**WildGo Animals:**\r\nelephants’ habitat will become significantly hotter and drier, resulting in poorer foraging conditions and threatening calf survival. Increasing conflict with human populations taking over more and more elephant habitat and poaching for ivory are additional threats that are placing the elephant’s future at risk.\r\n\r\nDefenders of Wildlife is working through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to maintain a ban on the sale of ivory as well as on regulations that govern worldwide elephant protection.\r\n![african  elephants  largest  animals  on  earth](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/pictures/mammals/a/african-elephant/african-elephant_01.ngsversion.1474903832871.adapt.676.1.JPG)\r\nCOMMON NAME: African Elephant\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC NAME: Loxodonta africana\r\n\r\nTYPE: Mammals\r\n\r\nDIET: Herbivores\r\n\r\nGROUP NAME: Herd\r\n\r\nAVERAGE LIFESPAN IN THE WILD: up to 70 years\r\n\r\nSIZE: Height at the shoulder, 8.2 to 13 ft\r\n\r\nWEIGHT: 2.5 to 7 tons!![elephants  are  very  stronger  than  humans](http://www.defenders.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/elephant-geoff-hall-dpc.jpg)\r\n\r\nLions :\r\n\r\nFor all of their roaring, growling, and ferociousness, lions are family animals and truly social in their own communities. They usually live in groups of 15 or more animals called prides. Prides can be as small as 3 or as big as 40 animals. In a pride, lions hunt prey, raise cubs, and defend their territory together. In prides the females do most of the hunting and cub rearing. Usually all the lionesses in the pride are related—mothers, daughters, grandmothers, and sisters. Many of the females in the pride give birth at about the same time. A cub may nurse from other females as well as its mother. Each pride generally will have no more than two adult males. \r\n\r\n![lions are very  ferocious  animals](http://wallpapercave.com/wp/y26Qxfe.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhales :\r\n\r\nWhales belong to the order cetacea, which includes whales, dolphins and porpoises. Whales are divided into two suborders: baleen and toothed whales. Baleen whales have a comb-like fringe, called a baleen, on the upper jaw, which is used to filter plankton, as well as small fish and crustaceans. They are the largest species of whale. Toothed whales have teeth and prey on fish, squid, other whales and marine mammals. They sense their surrounding environment through echolocation.\r\n\r\nLike all mammals, whales breathe air into lungs, are warm-blooded, feed their young milk and have some (although very little) hair. Their bodies resemble the streamlined form of a fish, while the forelimbs or flippers are paddle-shaped. The tail fins, or flukes, enable whales to propel themselves through the water. Most species of whale have a fin on their backs known as a dorsal fin.\r\n\r\n![whales  are  largest  among   sea   animals](http://wallpapercave.com/wp/3hS5lap.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
